In this project, the Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. 
General search algorithms such as Depth First Search (DFS), Breadth First Search (BFS), Uniform Cost Search (UCS), AStar Search are built and applied to Pacman scenarios.
